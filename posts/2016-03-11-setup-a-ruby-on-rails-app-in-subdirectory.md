Letâ€™s say my Ruby on Rails app is mounted in `mydomain.com/myapp` what should I do to make it works well is putting these two lines into `config/application.rb` inside `class Application :`

 config.action_controller.relative_url_root = '/myapp' Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:original_script_name] = '/myapp'
