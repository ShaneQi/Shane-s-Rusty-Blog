## TL;DR
* App Capabilities
* Notification Payload
* User's Permission

## App Capabilities
Both `Push Notifications` and `Remote Notifications` need to be turned on in Xcode.

## Notification Payload
The payloadâ€™s `aps` dictionary must include the `content-available` key with a value of `1`.

```
{
	"aps": {
		"content-available": 1,
		...
	},
	...
}
```

## User's Permission

The app has to acquire as least one of these four permissions: `alert`, `sound`, `badge`, `background app refresh`.

This can be check in app by: `UIApplication.shared.isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications` (iOS 8.0 and later).
